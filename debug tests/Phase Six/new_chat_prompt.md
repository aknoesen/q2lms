# New Chat Session Prompt

I'm working on a question database manager with auto-renumbering functionality. I've successfully implemented the auto-renumbering logic that eliminates ID conflicts when merging question databases, but I'm stuck on a UI integration issue.

## Current Status
- **Auto-renumbering works perfectly**: Backend reduces conflicts from 23 to 0 when merging 25+23 questions
- **Console logs confirm success**: "Auto-renumbered 23 questions from ID 25 to 47" and "0 conflicts detected"
- **UI integration blocked**: Merge preview interface shows "No preview data available" and becomes unresponsive
- **Multiple solutions attempted**: Plan B merge function, direct merge button, debug logging - all implemented but inaccessible due to UI freeze

## The Problem
When I upload files for merging:
1. ✅ Auto-renumbering executes perfectly (console confirms)
2. ✅ Preview should show 48 questions with 0 conflicts  
3. ❌ UI shows "No preview data available" instead
4. ❌ Interface becomes completely unresponsive
5. ❌ Cannot access merge buttons to complete the operation

## Technical Details  
- **Files**: `modules/upload_interface_v2.py`, `modules/database_merger.py`, `streamlit_app.py`
- **Framework**: Streamlit with Phase 3D upload interface
- **Issue Location**: `render_merge_preview_interface()` function can't access preview data
- **Root Cause**: Data pipeline between `create_merge_preview()` (working) and `st.session_state['preview_data']` (empty)

## What I Need Help With
I need to fix the UI integration so users can access the working auto-renumbering functionality. The merge preview interface should show the 0 conflicts and allow users to complete the merge to get 48 questions instead of being stuck.

**Environment**: Windows, instructor planning ECE courses, systematic top-down approach, MATLAB coding preferences, Davis CA location.

Can you help me debug why the preview data isn't reaching the UI and fix the integration issue?
