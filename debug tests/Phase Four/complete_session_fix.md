# Question Database Manager - Session Management Fix

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Your Question Database Manager now properly handles file loading and session management. Here's what was fixed:

### ❌ Previous Issues:
- Previous database history was kept when loading new files
- No clear way to remove current file and load a new one
- Confusing state when uploading different files
- Session state pollution between different uploads

### ✅ Now Fixed:
- **Clean session management** - proper cleanup between file loads
- **Database history** - save up to 5 recent databases for easy restoration
- **Clear file lifecycle** - easy to replace, append, or restore databases
- **Smart upload detection** - knows when you're uploading a new vs. existing file

## 🔧 Key Components Added

### 1. Session State Management (`clear_session_state()`)
```python
def clear_session_state():
    """Clear all database-related session state"""
    keys_to_clear = [
        'df', 'metadata', 'original_questions', 'cleanup_reports', 
        'filename', 'processing_options', 'batch_processed_files',
        'quiz_questions', 'current_page', 'last_page'
    ]
    
    for key in keys_to_clear:
        if key in st.session_state:
            del st.session_state[key]
    
    # Clear any edit-related session states
    edit_keys = [key for key in st.session_state.keys() if 'edit_' in key]
    for key in edit_keys:
        del st.session_state[key]
```

### 2. Database History System
- **Automatic saving** to history when loading new files
- **Easy restoration** from recent databases
- **Memory management** - keeps only last 5 databases
- **Metadata preservation** - full database state saved

### 3. Enhanced Upload Interface
- **Visual status indicators** - clearly shows what's loaded
- **Smart file detection** - knows if file is new or already loaded
- **One-click operations** - "Clear & Load New", "Save to History"
- **Advanced options** - batch processing, append modes

## 🚀 How to Use the Fixed System

### Loading Your First Database:
1. **Upload a JSON file** using the file uploader
2. **Configure processing options** (LaTeX, validation, etc.)
3. **Click "Load Database"** - your database is now active

### Loading a New Database:
1. **Option A**: Click "🔄 Load New Database" (saves current to history)
2. **Option B**: Click "🗑️ Clear All" (removes everything)
3. **Option C**: Upload new file and it will detect the change

### Managing Multiple Databases:
1. **History**: Previous databases are automatically saved
2. **Restore**: Use the "Recent Database History" section
3. **Compare**: Load different databases to compare content

## 🎓 Perfect for Course Planning

This is ideal for your MATLAB course planning workflow:

### Typical Workflow:
1. **Load your main question database** (e.g., `MATLAB_Questions_V1.json`)
2. **Browse & edit questions** with live LaTeX preview
3. **Create topic-specific quizzes** using filters
4. **Export to Canvas** as QTI packages
5. **Load updated database** when you have new questions
6. **Restore previous versions** if needed

### LaTeX Integration:
- **Mathematical notation** renders properly: `Z = R + j\omega L`
- **Engineering units** display correctly: `f = 1000 Hz`
- **Complex equations** supported: `H(j\omega) = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}`

## 📝 Integration Instructions

To integrate these fixes into your existing `streamlit_app.py`:

1. **Replace** the existing `enhanced_upload_interface()` function with the new version
2. **Add** all the session management functions
3. **Update** your `main()` function to use `smart_upload_interface()`
4. **Test** with your first 50 converted questions

### Key Files to Update:
- `streamlit_app.py` - main application
- Add the session management functions at the top
- Replace the upload interface functions
- Update the main() function

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

✅ **Load a database** - should work cleanly  
✅ **Clear and load new** - should remove all previous data  
✅ **View history** - should show recent databases  
✅ **Restore from history** - should bring back previous database  
✅ **Upload same file twice** - should detect and handle gracefully  
✅ **Browse & Edit** - should work with live preview  
✅ **Export functions** - should work with current database  

## 🎉 Result

You now have a robust Question Database Manager that:
- ✅ **Cleanly handles file replacement**
- ✅ **Maintains database history** 
- ✅ **Provides clear state management**
- ✅ **Supports your LaTeX workflow**
- ✅ **Works perfectly for course planning**

Your 50 converted LaTeX questions should now load, display, and edit properly without any session state interference from previous uploads!
