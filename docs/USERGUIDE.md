## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating Questions from Scratch

**Purpose**: Start a new question database or add questions to existing collections

**Method A: Direct Creation in Q2LMS**
1. Navigate to the **Question Editor** tab
2. Click "Add New Question"
3. Select question type (Multiple Choice, True/False, Short Answer, Essay, etc.)
4. Enter question content using the rich text editor
5. Add answer options and mark correct answers
6. Preview LaTeX rendering in real-time
7. Save question to active database

**Method B: AI-Assisted Creation with Q2Prompt (Recommended)**
1. Access **Q2Prompt** (companion tool for Q2LMS)
2. Input your learning objectives and topic requirements
3. Generate AI prompts tailored for educational question creation
4. Use generated prompts with your preferred LLM (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
5. Export results as Q2LMS-compatible JSON format
6. Import JSON file into Q2LMS using the Upload Interface
7. Review and refine questions in Q2LMS Question Editor

**Expected Outcome**: New question added to your working database with proper formatting

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: Q2Prompt streamlines bulk question creation by generating structured prompts that produce Q2LMS-compatible JSON output. This approach is especially efficient for creating large question banks or when working with specific learning objectives.

### Workflow 2: Importing Existing Question Banks

**Purpose**: Integrate existing question collections into Q2LMS

**Steps**:
1. Go to **Upload Interface**

   - **CSV** (requires format conversion)
   - **QTI packages** (imported from other LMS platforms)
4. Review conflict resolution options if duplicate questions detected
5. Confirm import settings and process files
6. Verify imported questions in the Question Editor

**Expected Outcome**: Existing questions integrated into Q2LMS with preserved formatting and metadata

> **ðŸ“‹ Note**: Q2LMS works best with JSON-formatted input files. If you have questions in other formats, consider using Q2Prompt to help convert and structure them properly, or use the built-in format conversion tools in the Upload Interface.

> **ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start**: Try uploading `examples/sample_questions.json` first to familiarize yourself with the import process before working with your own data.

### Workflow 3: Editing and Refining Questions

**Purpose**: Modify existing questions with advanced editing features

**Steps**:
1. Access **Question Editor**
2. Browse or search existing questions using filters
3. Select question for editing
4. Use live preview to see LaTeX rendering
5. Modify question text, answers, or metadata
6. Apply bulk edits if working with multiple questions
7. Save changes to database

**Expected Outcome**: Updated questions with improved formatting and content accuracy

### Workflow 4: Exporting for LMS Deployment

**Purpose**: Generate LMS-compatible question packages for deployment

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to **Export Center**
2. Select questions for export (individual, filtered set, or entire database)
3. Choose export format:
   - **Canvas QTI**: For Canvas LMS deployment
   - **Generic QTI**: For other QTI-compatible systems
   - **Native JSON**: For backup and version control
   - **CSV**: For data analysis and reporting
4. Configure export settings (question randomization, answer shuffling, etc.)
5. Generate and download export package
6. Deploy to target LMS following platform-specific instructions

**Expected Outcome**: LMS-ready question packages optimized for your target platform
