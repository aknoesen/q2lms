## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Quick Start Issues**

**Q: Interface looks different from screenshots**
A: Ensure you're running the latest version with Phase 10 enhancements:
```bash
git pull origin main
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

**Q: "Show All" not displaying all questions**
A: Phase 10 defaults to "Show All" but check the pagination dropdown:
- Look for pagination controls above question list
- Select "Show All" from dropdown if not already selected
- For very large databases (1000+ questions), consider using topic filters

**Q: Export completion guidance not appearing**
A: Ensure you've selected/marked questions in operation mode:
- Choose Select Questions or Delete Questions mode
- Use checkboxes to select/mark questions
- Red completion notices appear when questions are ready for export

**Q: Upload failing with file format errors**
A: Check supported formats and file structure:
- **Supported**: `.json`, `.csv`, `.zip` (QTI packages)
- **JSON Structure**: Must include `questions` array with valid question objects
- **CSV Format**: Headers must match Q2LMS field names
- Try the sample data in `examples/` folder first

**Q: Statistics not displaying immediately**
A: Phase 10 shows stats before tabs when questions are loaded:
- Ensure questions uploaded successfully (check Upload tab status)
- Refresh browser if statistics don't appear
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Q: LaTeX math not rendering**
A: Verify LaTeX syntax and browser compatibility:
- Check for unmatched braces `{}` or dollar signs `$$`
- Use Q2LMS live preview to test equations
- Ensure modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### **Performance Optimization**

**Large Database Handling**:
- **Topic Filtering**: Use sidebar filters to focus on specific content areas
- **Batch Operations**: Use bulk select/delete controls for efficiency
- **Memory Management**: Close other browser tabs if interface becomes slow
- **Chunked Processing**: Phase 10 automatically optimizes large dataset handling

**Browser Optimization**:
- **Modern Browser**: Use updated Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
- **JavaScript Enabled**: Required for Phase 10 interactive features
- **Clear Cache**: Refresh browser cache if experiencing issues
- **Extensions**: Disable ad blockers or script blockers if interface problems occur

## üéì **Best Practices for Instructors**

### **Question Database Organization**

**Topic Structure**:
- Use consistent topic naming (e.g., "Chapter 1", "Unit 2", "Functions")
- Group related concepts under broader topics
- Consider hierarchical organization for large courses

**Point Values**:
- Assign points reflecting question difficulty and importance
- Use consistent scale across similar question types
- Consider total exam/quiz point targets when selecting

**Metadata Completeness**:
- Add difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) for balanced assessments
- Include learning objectives or standards alignment
- Use author fields for collaborative question banking

### **Assessment Creation Workflow**

**Phase 10 Recommended Process**:
1. **Upload and Review**: Import questions and review complete database overview
2. **Analyze Coverage**: Use Analytics tab to assess content balance
3. **Filter and Select**: Use topic filters and Select Questions mode for targeted curation
4. **Validate Selection**: Review statistics and point totals before export
5. **Export with Guidance**: Follow completion notices to generate LMS packages

**Quality Assurance**:
- Preview questions in Q2LMS before export
- Test LaTeX rendering for mathematical content
- Validate answer keys and correct responses
- Review point values and difficulty balance

### **Collaborative Question Banking**

**Team Workflows**:
- Use JSON export/import for version control and sharing
- Establish consistent metadata standards across team members
- Regular database cleanup using Delete Questions mode
- Shared topic taxonomies for consistent organization

**Version Control**:
- Export to JSON for Git repository management
- Tag releases for major question bank updates
- Document changes and additions in commit messages
- Regular backups using JSON export format
